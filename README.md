Results of using a CNN to play a self-coded minesweeper. No user interface to see the model perform live but wouldn't require much extra effort to try printing out what it's doing.

Pretrained models included in repository. Approximate performance of these pretrained models are:

Beginner board: 95% win rate
Intermediate board: 81% win rate
Expert board: 33% win rate

Win rates approach accepted theoretical maximum and performs at the level of a very experienced player.
